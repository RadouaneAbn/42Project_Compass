# Contributing to 42Project Compass

Thank you for considering contributing to this project! Your contributions are highly valued and appreciated. Contributions can range from fixing simple typos to implementing major new features.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Fork the Repository

1. Fork the repository by clicking the "Fork" button at the top right of the project page.
2. Clone your fork to your local machine

### 2. If Your Contribution Is a Learning Objective or Resource Addition:

1. Navigate to the directory of your cloned fork:

   ```bash
   cd 42project_compass
   ```

2. Depending on your contribution type:
   - For learning objectives, go to the `learning_objectives` folder.
   - For resources, go to the `resources` folder.

3. If the project file doesn’t already exist, create a new JSON file named after the project's identifier. 

   **Example**: For the `libft` project, use the project URL to determine the name:
   - Project link: 
     ```
     https://projects.intra.42.fr/42cursus-libft/mine
     ```
     or
     ```
     https://projects.intra.42.fr/projects/42cursus-libft
     ```
     The project name is `42cursus-libft`, so the file should be named `42cursus-libft.json`.

4. Follow these formats:
   - **Learning Objectives**:
     ```json
     [
       "Learning objective 1",
       "Learning objective 2"
     ]
     ```
   - **Resources**:
     ```json
     {
       "Resource topic 1": "link for resource 1",
       "Resource topic 2": "link for resource 2"
     }
     ```
